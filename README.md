SpaceLots is a fun exercise I built in React.js.

I started by designing the concept and UI in Figma,
then I used plain HTML and CSS to build the components,
and finally I created a react app using create-react-app npm.

In this project I use these hooks:
- useState
- useEffect
- useReducer
- useRef
- useContext
